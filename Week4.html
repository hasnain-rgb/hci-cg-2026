  <h2>Interaction Analysis: Norman and GOMS Applied to the “Who Paid?” App</h2>

  <section>
    <h3>Applying Norman’s 7 Stages of Action</h3>
    <p><strong>Task:</strong> User wants to check who paid last.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Form Goal</strong> – “I want to know who paid for the last expense.”</li>
      <li><strong>Form Intention</strong> – “I will check the app to find the last payer.”</li>
      <li><strong>Specify Action</strong> – “I will open the app and tap the history/recent payments section.”</li>
      <li><strong>Execute Action</strong> – The user opens the app and taps the relevant button.</li>
      <li><strong>Perceive State</strong> – The app displays a list of transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpret State</strong> – The user reads the name and date to identify who paid last.</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluate Outcome</strong> – The user confirms whether the goal is satisfied.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Typical Problems Found</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Norman (Gulf of Execution):</strong> Users don’t know where to tap to see who paid.</li>
      <li><strong>Norman (Gulf of Evaluation):</strong> The list does not clearly show “Last paid by”.</li>
      <li><strong>GOMS:</strong> Too many steps (menu → history → scroll) increase task time.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>Simple Design Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a clear label: <strong>“Last Paid By: ___”</strong> on the home screen.</li>
      <li>Make <strong>“Recent Payments”</strong> a primary button.</li>
      <li>Highlight the latest transaction.</li>
    </ul>
