    <h2>Context: The “Who Paid?” App</h2>
    <p>
      The “Who Paid?” app is a group expense application where users want to check
      who paid last or record a payment. A common usability problem is that users
      cannot clearly tell who made the most recent payment or what the current
      system state is.

    <h2>Applying Norman’s 7 Stages of Action</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>1. Form Goal</h3>
      <p><strong>User goal:</strong> “I want to check who paid for the last expense.”</p>
      <p>The user has a clear goal to find payment information.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>2. Form Intention</h3>
      <p><strong>Intention:</strong> “I will open the app and look for the last transaction.”</p>
      <p>The user decides to use the app to achieve the goal.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>3. Specify Action</h3>
      <p><strong>Action plan:</strong> “I will tap the ‘Recent Payments’ or ‘History’ section.”</p>
      <p>The user chooses which interface action to perform.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>4. Execute Action</h3>
      <p><strong>Execution:</strong> The user taps buttons or navigates through menus.</p>
      <p>If labels or icons are unclear, the user may not know what to tap.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>5. Perceive System State</h3>
      <p><strong>Perception:</strong> The app displays a list of transactions.</p>
      <p>The user sees names, amounts, and timestamps.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>6. Interpret System State</h3>
      <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> “This entry shows Ali paid the bill yesterday.”</p>
      <p>The user tries to understand what the system feedback means.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>7. Evaluate Outcome</h3>
      <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> “Yes, this answers my question about who paid last.”</p>
      <p>The user checks whether the goal has been achieved.</p>

    <h2>Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation in the “Who Paid?” App</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Gulf of Execution</h3>
      <p>
        The Gulf of Execution is the gap between what the user wants to do and
        what actions the interface makes visible or easy to perform.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Buttons may have unclear labels (e.g., “Log”, “Update”).</li>
        <li>Users may not know where to tap to see the last payer.</li>
        <li>Icons may not clearly represent their function.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Result:</strong> The user has the goal but does not know how to
        perform the correct action.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Gulf of Evaluation</h3>
      <p>
        The Gulf of Evaluation is the gap between what the system shows and
        how easily the user can understand the system’s state.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The app shows a list but does not clearly highlight who paid last.</li>
        <li>No explicit message such as “Last paid by ___”.</li>
        <li>Timestamps or names may be unclear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Result:</strong> The user performs the action but cannot easily
        interpret the outcome.
      </p>

    <h2>Design Improvements (Optional)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Add a clear label: <strong>“Last Paid By: Ahmed”</strong></li>
      <li>Highlight the most recent transaction</li>
      <li>Use icons with text labels (e.g., “Recent Payments”)</li>
      <li>Provide confirmation feedback (“Payment recorded successfully”)</li>
    </ul>
